## 🎨 COLOR PALETTE TRANSFORMATION

### From → To

**OLD:** Simple blacks, whites, and golds  
**NEW:** Sophisticated aged palette

### New Color System

**Base & Neutrals (Warm, Aged Tones)**
- Aged Ivory: `#F5F1E8` - Primary background
- Parchment: `#EDE8DC` - Secondary backgrounds
- Soft Charcoal: `#3A3732` - Text and headings
- Antique Brown: `#6B5D52` - Body text
- Warm Cream: `#FAF7F0` - Accent backgrounds

**Earth & Botanical**
- Moss Green: `#7A8B6F` - Primary accent
- Olive Green: `#8B9578` - Secondary accent
- Sage Muted: `#A4B39A` - Subtle highlights

**Soft Romantic Tones**
- Dusty Rose: `#C9A7A0` - Soft accents
- Muted Blush: `#D4B5AF` - Delicate touches
- Mauve: `#B69B9F` - Romantic highlights

**Intentional Color Pops**
- Teal: `#5A8C8C` - Primary interactive color
- Sapphire: `#456B8C` - Secondary interactive
- Marigold: `#D4A150` - Accent highlights

**Philosophy:** Light backgrounds feel warm, creamy, and aged (never pure white). Dark tones feel smoky and reflective. Colors appear most strongly through imagery, not UI blocks.

**NO MORE STACKED BLOCKS** - Each section flows into the next with gradient backgrounds and overlapping visual elements.

## ✨ TEXTURE & DEPTH IMPLEMENTATION

   - Medium shadows: `0 12px 40px rgba(58, 55, 50, 0.12)`
   - Deep shadows: `0 20px 60px rgba(58, 55, 50, 0.18)`
   - Text shadows for dimensional typography

4. **Border Accents**
   - Left/top borders with brand colors
   - Gradient underlines that appear on hover
   - Reveal animations from left to right
